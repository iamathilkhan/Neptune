# Neptune 🌊

Welcome to **Neptune**, an innovative Flask-based web application that brings the ocean to your fingertips! Neptune features an engaging chat interface focused on marine topics, powered by lightweight machine learning models for fishing and disaster prediction. Built with simplicity and exploration in mind, it leverages neural networks to provide intelligent insights into oceanic phenomena.

This project was developed with a bit of help from AI tools to enhance creativity and efficiency in coding and design.

## Features

- **Ocean-Focused Chat UI**: Interact with a user-friendly chat interface tailored for marine discussions and queries.
- **Machine Learning Predictions**: Utilize neural network-based models for predicting fishing opportunities and potential disasters at sea.
- **FAISS Vectorstore**: Efficient similarity search built from ocean-related datasets for enhanced chat responses.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Designed for quick setup and minimal resource usage, perfect for development and exploration.
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of routes, models, and templates for easy customization and extension.
